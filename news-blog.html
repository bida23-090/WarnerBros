                        Constantine 2, a sequel the actor has long desired to make that was recently confirmed to be in
                        development with original director Francis Lawrence also returning. Warner Bros.' <br><br>
                        Shift towards the new film ultimately resulted in the cancelation of the HBO Max reboot with His
                        House's Sope Dirisu having been in talks to star. While the future of The Sandman remains
                        unclear, one star is addressing Reeves stepping back into his cult favorite role. <br><br>

                        <br><br>
                        Though Coleman may not offer a proper statement on Reeves' Constantine 2, her interest in seeing
                        more of the occult detective on screen is sure to ring true with fans of the character. Even
                        prior to The Sandman's release, Coleman had expressed her interest in leading a Johanna
                        Constantine spinoff show, having recently also shared that Gaiman is similarly interested in
                        making the project happen and is currently developing a possible idea with showrunner Allan
                        Heinberg. <br><br> Given Netflix has yet to greenlight The Sandman season 2, it's understandable
                        Coleman's Constantine spinoff may not ultimately get off the ground, though her devotion to the
                        character speaks volumes for fans eager to see respectful portrayals of the beloved character.

                        Director Patty Jenkins teases the possibility of Wonder Woman 4, despite filming on Wonder Woman
                        3 having yet to begin. Having joined the DC Extended Universe back in 2016's Batman V Superman:
                        Dawn of Justice, Gadot's Wonder Woman, otherwise known as Diana Prince, has already established
                        her position as one of the DCEU's heavy hitters. <br><br> Her two standalone appearances, Wonder
                        Woman and Wonder Woman 1984, have enjoyed considerable success with their respective 2017 and
                        2020 releases. <br><br> While the audience's reception of Wonder Woman 1984 was somewhat less
                        favorable when compared to that of its predecessor, it wasn't long before confirmation came that
                        Wonder Woman 3 was in the works, with Jenkins set to return once again to round out her trilogy.
                        <br><br>
                        While details surrounding Wonder Woman 3 have been sparse, small updates have been provided
                        sporadically from both the director and Gadot herself, with both having expressed their mutual
                        excitement to continue Diana's story. Earlier this year, Gadot shared that Wonder Woman 3 could
                        begin filming at some point in 2023, though any official timeline for the film's production or
                        release has yet to be confirmed.<br><br>
                        During a recent appearance at Matera Film Festival, Jenkins opened up about how each Wonder
                        Woman film has spurred on her desire to continue Diana's story further, despite having initially
                        only planned to do one film.

                        <br><br>
                        While confirming that she now has a completed script for Wonder Woman 3, the director shared
                        that this trend had continued, as she is now interested in exploring Diana's story past the
                        events of this third installment. Jenkins quickly added that she has a number of other projects
                        on the horizon that she is also excited to work on, though this quick tease of the possibility
                        of Wonder Woman 4 did not go unnoticed. Check out Jenkins' full quote below. <br><br> <img
                            class="img-fluid" src="assets/news img/Wonder-Woman-1984.jpg" alt="">
                        <br><br>
                        Given the success of the previous Wonder Woman films, it’s likely that DC is far from finished
                        with the exploration of Diana Prince’s story, even despite the fact that former Warner Bros.
                        chairman Toby Emmerich previously stated that Wonder Woman 3 will serve as the finale of Gadot
                        and Jenkins' "long-planned" Wonder Woman trilogy.
                        <br><br>
                        This is not the first time that Jenkins has teased that she has more stories in mind for just
                        how Diana’s story could continue on past the events of Wonder Woman 3, although similarly to
                        these new comments, Jenkins also previously stated that these may or may not happen under her
                        direction.

                        Tom Holland and Jacob Batalon in Spider Man No Way Home ending
                        Spider-Man: No Way Home star Jacob Batalon shares his emotional reaction to being part of the
                        MCU and potentially saying goodbye to his character Ned Leeds after Spidey's most recent outing.
                        Releasing late in 2021, Spider-Man: No Way Home not only closed the narrative arcs of Tom
                        Holland's first trilogy as Marvel's web-swinging icon, but also culminated in the joining of
                        three generations worth of the titular character. <br><br> To the delights of moviegoers, Tobey
                        Maguire and Andrew Garfield both reprized their roles as different iterations of Spider-Man,
                        allying with Holland to face off against fellow franchise veterans Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina
                        and Jamie Foxx. <br><br> Though it was not only the heroes of an older on-screen generation that
                        aided Holland's Spidey in his biggest test yet, but also Batalon's wise-cracking and magically
                        gifted best-friend Ned, alongside the equally bold and resourceful Michelle "MJ" Jones played by
                        Zendaya.
                        <br><br>
                        This triad of the titular hero backed up by his unwaveringly loyal companions was already one of
                        the more popular in the MCU; making them part of the wider arcs of returning characters from
                        previously beloved generations of the comic-book movie genre only increased this
                        popularity.<br><br>
                        However, after the emotional ending of Spider-Man: No Way Home, in which the entire world's
                        memory of Peter Parker was erased, it is yet to be seen whether the trio will ever
                        reunite.<br><br>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/news img/Spider-Man-No-Way-Home-Ending-Peter-Ned-and-MJ.jpg"
                            alt="">
                        <br><br>
                        While it hasn't been officially added to the release calendar yet, Kevin Feige confirmed the
                        MCU's Spider-Man 4 is in development, with Holland being eyed to reprise the titular role again.
                        Sony is expecting director Jon Watts and Zendaya to return for Spider-Man 4 as well, but
                        nothing's been confirmed.
                        <br><br>
                        Given the success of the Spider-Man: Homecoming trilogy, it's understandable why the studio
                        would be interested in keeping the core team intact. Holland's chemistry with Batalon and
                        Zendaya served as the emotional core of Spider-Man's solo MCU outings, and viewers would enjoy
                        seeing them onscreen again. <br><br> However, a quick reunion between the three would run the
                        risk of
                        undoing Spider-Man: No Way Home's poignant ending. As Batalon notes, No Way Home's conclusion
                        could allow for more Spider-Man adventures with a different supporting cast. A Spider-Man 4
                        could still be a ways off however, as Marvel makes its way through the Multiverse Saga.

                        With the release of the trailer, The Super Mario Bros. Movie is already a divisive topic, with
                        exception to Bowser who's shaped up to be the best thing about the film. The first trailer for
                        The Super Mario Bros.<br><br> Movie has given a glimpse into Nintendo and Illumination's
                        animated adaptation of the classic video game franchise. The movie continues the recent string
                        of video game adaptations, with Detective Pikachu, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Uncharted all proving
                        to be popular and generally performing well at the global box office. <br><br> Controversially,
                        rather than using or imitating the Nintendo character's voices from the video games, The Super
                        Mario Bros. Movie cast is made up of Hollywood's biggest stars and most familiar voices. Similar
                        to how devoted SEGA fans responded to the original "ugly Sonic" design for 2020's Sonic the
                        Hedgehog, long-time Nintendo players have reacted negatively to Chris Pratt's voice for Mario.
                        The Super Mario Bros.
                        <br><br>
                        Movie trailer only gives Mario a couple of lines, but both sound exactly like Pratt, a dramatic
                        change from the character's famously distinctive Italian accent. Despite the backlash to Chris
                        Pratt's Mario voice, the trailer suggests that one Super Mario character has been adapted
                        perfectly for the movie.<br><br>
                        Bowser, Mario's greatest enemy in the video games, looks set to be the best part of The Super
                        Mario Bros. Movie. Voiced by the legendary Jack Black, Bowser is the focus of the movie's first
                        trailer, and he has already been painted out to be a ruthless monster.<br><br>Bowser's look is a
                        faithful take on his video game design, but arguably, and more importantly, the energy and
                        characterization that Black brings to the role are in keeping with the Bowser that Nintendo fans
                        know and love. Unlike Pratt's uninspired voice work, it's clear that veteran voice actor Jack
                        Black knows exactly what he wants Bowser to be. The actor has successfully captured the King of
                        the Koopas video-game aggression while injecting elements of his own fun personality.

                        In Disney's 2021 film, Encanto, the magical house Casita fails to protect the primary
                        protagonist, Mirabel, even when Mirabel goes on a quest to save Casita from falling apart.
                        Casita isn't thoughtless or careless, though, and has good reason for not helping Mirabel at
                        certain points in the film. <br><br> Mirabel, a young woman who doesn't get powers in a family
                        where every member receives a special gift on their fifth birthday, wants to prove herself
                        worthy to her family. The family resides in a sentient house, lovingly nicknamed Casita, who
                        often helps Mirabel throughout the film. However, when Mirabel is exploring Bruno's hidden room
                        and the walls that he hides behind, Casita's help is noticeably absent. <br><br> When Mirabel is
                        on her quest to figure out what is making Casita crumble and why her family is losing their
                        magical powers, she sets off to find Bruno, her uncle. When Mirabel was younger, he left the
                        family to protect her because he received the gift of prophecy but Bruno's visions always seemed
                        to be bad news.

                        Each member of the Madrigal family has a special room tailored to them that Casita creates for
                        them when they get their magical power. Throughout the film, only two rooms besides Bruno's are
                        seen and both times Casita is able to use its magic within the bedrooms.<br><br>
                        When Mirabel was in Bruno's room, it was full of sand and hard to navigate, but Casita offered
                        no assistance, even when the room started to collapse. Casita also fails to protect Mirabel when
                        she nearly dies while chasing Bruno inside the walls of the house.<br><br>
                        Casita is concealing a secret, Bruno, and the hidden spaces within the house provide an
                        opportunity to conceal that secret. Because Bruno has stepped away from the family, the light on
                        his door is dim, indicating that Casita's magic doesn't work in there anymore. Just like any
                        other room, though, it was once enchanted and Bruno's room may serve as a metaphor for the
                        heartbreak he endured trying to protect Mirabel.
                        <br><br>
                        Much like any other member of the Madrigal family, Casita has its own pressures and desires.
                        Casita is bound together by the Madrigals' love for one another and relies on their unity to
                        stay alive, much like they rely on Casita for its magic. Casita also doesn't hesitate to knock
                        some sense into them when they are misbehaving. <br><br>
                        For example, Casita lets Mirabel walk into a pole early in the film after she snaps at her
                        sister. When Casita sees how the Madrigals, especially Abuela, are treating Bruno it makes the
                        decision to conceal Bruno by dismantling its own magic and giving Bruno a safe place to retreat.

                        Captain Marvel has already displayed her immense powers in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but a
                        recent interview has teased the possibility of her being even more powerful in The Marvels.
                        <br><br> Since making her onscreen debut in Captain Marvel, Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel (Brie
                        Larson) has made limited appearances in the MCU, appearing only in Avengers: Endgame, the
                        mid-credit scene in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, and in a brief cameo in Ms.
                        Marvel. Perhaps, inevitably, this will change with the release of The Marvels, where she will be
                        joined by her superfan Kamala Khan/Ms. Marvel (Iman Vellani) and her best friend’s daughter
                        Monica Rambeau (Teyonah Parris). <br><br> Details on what to expect from the Nia
                        DaCosta-directed sequel have been limited. However, Fast and Furious 10 cast member, Brie
                        Larson, has suggested that The Marvels will show an uneasy team-up between the three main
                        characters.
                        <br><br>
                        This unease was caused, in part, by the anger Rambeau had shown towards Danvers in Wandavision,
                        and the swapping of powers which was hinted at by Captain Marvel’s brief appearance in Ms.
                        Marvel and in footage from The Marvels revealed at the D23 Expo.<br><br>
                        In addition, Brie Larson has hinted at the possibility of her character’s powers being expanded
                        in comparison to what audiences have seen before. In an interview, she described the physical
                        strain that training for The Marvels had taken before adding, “what's different with this movie
                        from the first one is that Carol didn't fly until the end, so I didn't have as much wire work
                        stuff” (via EW).<br><br>
                        <img class="img-fluid" src="assets/news img/Monica-Rambeau---Captain-Marvel---Ms-Marvel.jpg"
                            alt="">
                        <br><br>
                        This certainly suggests that Carol Danvers is fully embracing her powers. After all, Captain
                        Marvel was an origin story in which she didn’t do much flying and while her most powerful moment
                        in Avengers: Endgame involved her flying in and single-handedly destroying Thanos' Sanctuary II
                        flagship, her screentime was still rather limited.
                        <br><br>
                        As a result, the implication that Captain Marvel will spend a significant amount of time in
                        flight during The Marvels may suggest that the movie would show off how powerful she had become
                        and push her powers further than had been seen before.
